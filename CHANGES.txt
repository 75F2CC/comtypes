1.0
---

* #27: Replaced the ``partial`` module with a ``patcher`` module. This new
  technique patches the underlying classes explicitly. This technique avoids
  the problems with the metaclass magic on Python 3.
* Officially dropped support for Python 2.5.
* #25: Allow installation on non-Windows systems.
* #31: Improved 64-bit compatibility by specifying argtypes for GetMessage.
